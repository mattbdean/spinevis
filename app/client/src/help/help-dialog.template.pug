    h3 Interacting with the 3D figure

    p <strong>Left click and drag</strong> to rotate
    p <strong>Right click and drag</strong> to pan
    p <strong>Scroll</strong> to zoom in and out


    h3 Adding data

    p You can choose a section of data focus on by using the <strong>toggles</strong>
     |  on the right side of the screen or <strong>clicking on a colored mask in the 3D figure</strong>.
     |  The fluorescence data for that section of the data will appear on the <strong>bottom plot</strong>.

    h3 Visualization settings

    p Visual settings are located on the <strong>left side of the screen</strong>.
     |  You can change the opacities of both the raw data and the masks using their
     |  sliders. The <strong>threshold slider</strong> changes the minimum and maximum
     |  required fluorescence for raw data to appear on the screen. An extra-low
     |  minimum threshold might result in non-data being shown, while an extra-high
     |  maximum threshold might result in no data being visible.

    h3 Viewing data over time

    p The <strong>bottom section</strong> of the screen is dedicated to viewing
     |  fluorescence as a function of time. You can explore the graph by using the
     |  tools at the top right of that plot.

    h3 Using Plotly

    p See <a href="https://help.plot.ly/getting-to-know-the-plotly-modebar/">here</a>
